# Fundamentals of Astrodynamics

Here I will be going through the book _"**Fundamentals of Astrodynamics**, by Roger R. Bate, Donald D. Mueller, and Jerry E. White"_ and posting my solution to the exercises in each chapter that require some code/that I find interesting. Most likely, I will try to do as many problems as I can per chapter. For starters, I will be solving them using Python (Jupyter Notebooks), but this may change as I go along the book or I find a better format to do it. 

The book can be bought from Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Astrodynamics-Dover-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486600610/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MQ9JQRTTP7G3&dchild=1&keywords=fundamentals+of+astrodynamics&qid=1604075436&sprefix=fundamentals+of+astro%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-2)

I will try to upload solutions consistenly, but it might vary based on how busy I am. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
